# Syllabus and News for CS594/690: Advanced Software Engineering



* **Course:** [COSCS-540]
* ** MWF 11:30AM-12:20 mk524 and online Zoom bridge https://tennessee.zoom.us/j/81105897325  ** 
** [recordings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LK44Vwb6EotYQtZdYa-Wr-NpjT81XHHY?usp=sharing)
* **Instructor:** Audris Mockus, [audris@utk.edu](mailto:audris@utk.edu) office hours - on request
* **TA** Oktay Ozturk [oozturk@vols.utk.edu](mailto:oozturk@vols.utk.edu) office hours - on request

The primary purpose of the course is to learn-by-doing advanced
software engineering techniques including:
1. Big Data
1. Text analysis, e.g., LLMs, Word2Vec, GloVe, NMF, LDA, LSTM
2. Image analysis, e.g., RCNN, Mask-RCNN, CAM, ...
3. Network analysis, network databases (neo4j), ...

Each of the techniques will be learned through work on a real project. 

Tthree outcomes for this class: 
- present an existing research paper on any SE topic (prepared with a team)
- produce and present an innovative software project (a tool, paper, dataset as an outcome) also prepared with a team
- complete a set of tasks
